# TwoRageAutomotiveReciepts

This project is considered to be the prototype version of TwoRageAutoRep-t.

In this application the user may be able to create PDF invoices based on the information entered within text fields.
Service TextFields and Service Cost TextFields may be added or removed upon the user's discretion. 
Error checking is included for safety measures when the user inputs invalid data or leaves certain fields blank.
When the information has been entered correctly, a PDF will be created within the directory of the Application.
User can send the invoices to clients with the Email Screen (Errors occur if this is not used frequently due to having to Google having the 'less apps secure setting' turning on if left unactive).

UPDATE: Email Functionality is now completely functional without having any issues with Google Secutity measures. (Google 2 Step Verification enabled + App Passwords made this possible).

As of March 10, 2019 changes are being made to the project.
A file labeled CHANGES.txt will be included to see what will be added along with the status of each feature.
Steps for each change are also included to show the work flow to complete the feature.
